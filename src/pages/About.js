      Seb's Restaurant was founded with a passion for providing high-quality dining experiences that bring people together. Our story began in 2010 when our founder, Sebastian, noticed a lack of restaurants in the area that focused on fresh, locally-sourced ingredients and exceptional service.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">With a background in the culinary arts and a desire to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, Sebastian set out to create Seb's Restaurant. He sourced the freshest ingredients from local farmers and built a team of talented chefs who shared his passion for creating dishes that are as delicious as they are visually stunning.</p>
      <p className="about-text">Since then, Seb's Restaurant has become a beloved fixture in the community, known for our exceptional food, warm hospitality, and commitment to sustainability. We believe that food is more than just sustenance â€“ it's an experience that should be savored and shared with friends and family.</p>
      <p className="about-text">Our mission is to create unforgettable dining experiences that celebrate the best of local ingredients and showcase the talents of our skilled chefs. We strive to provide a warm and welcoming atmosphere where our guests can relax, unwind, and enjoy the company of their loved ones.</p>
